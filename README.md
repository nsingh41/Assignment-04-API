This is an Api which runs on localhost at port number 2501.

This basically GET,POST,DELETE and PUT  information of books via JSon object.

We are putting the sample of the object in "sample.txt"

We have created our server in hapi frameworks and connectivity is with mongodb and all these things are in "index.js".

All the functionality via routing functions is in "routes/books.js".

We got a little validation on the name length of author and title and genere..

We tried to put the limit of 5 books as well.

You need to install Happi,joi,mongojs,package.JSON and postman to run this api
